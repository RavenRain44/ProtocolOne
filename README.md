# ProtocolOne
Repository for the game Protocol One by Nexora Studios. Powered by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.6.1.

## Getting Started
This repository is for the roblox game Protocol One. It uses Rojo to communicate between Roblox Studio and Visual Studio Code.

## Setup
If you run into any issues during the installation process, DM RavenRain44 on Discord with the issue.

#### Step 1. Install Visual Studio Code

Click on [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) to install visual studio code. From the official website.

#### Step 2. Get Rokit

Go to [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/releases/latest) and scroll down to get the `rokit-X.X.X-windows-x86_64.zip` (assuming you are on windows)

If you aren't on windows, get the release that matches your computer. For Linux users, good luck. ;)

#### Step 3. Setup Visual Studio Code

Open your Visual Studio Code

In the top left, click `File -> Open Folder`, then create and open the folder to hold the project files.
I recommend making a "Code" folder in your "Documents" folder and then another folder inside your new "Code" folder labelled "ProtocolOne".
Once inside the new folder, press the "Open" button.

Don't make any files yet.

Next, click on the extensions tab on the left bar (looks like 4 blocks with 1 rotated)

Download the extensions: (* = optional)
- Luau language Server
- Rojo - Roblox Studio Sync
- Selene*
- SyLua*

#### Step 4. Finally, import the repository.

If you don't already have it, get [git](https://git-scm.com/install/) from the official website and go through the installation process.
After this, you will most likely need to restart your computer to verify changes.

Then, go back to Visual Studio Code and open the terminal from the top left by clicking `Terminal -> New Terminal`.
A terminal should pop up from the bottom. In this terminal, do the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RavenRain44/ProtocolOne.git . 
```

After this, everything should be set up.
